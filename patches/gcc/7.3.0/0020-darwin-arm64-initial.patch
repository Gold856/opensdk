Subject: [PATCH] aarch64: fix conflicting declarations

aarch64_get_extension_string_for_isa_flags is declared in
"aarch64-protos.h", use that instead of re-declaring it improperly.

	* config/aarch64/driver-aarch64.c: Include "aarch64-protos.h".
	(aarch64_get_extension_string_for_isa_flags): Don't declare.

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Darwin: Adjust the PCH area to allow for 16384byte page
 size.

Newer versions of Darwin report pagesize 20 which means that we
need to adjust the aligment of the PCH area.

gcc/ChangeLog:

	* config/host-darwin.c: Align pch_address_space to 16384.
